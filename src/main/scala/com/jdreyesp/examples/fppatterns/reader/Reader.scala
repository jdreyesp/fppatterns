/**
  * Created by jreyes on 3/1/18.
  *
  * In functional programming, itâ€™s a common practice to compose and build computation pipelines
  * and defer evaluation until the end.
  *
  * The computation op in the earlier section is a Function1 that may need to be composed with a monadic pipeline
  * containing a List or an Option. You need monad transformers for this kind of composition.
  * But Function1 doesnâ€™t have any transformer that can be used to stack up your computation into a monadic pipeline.
  *
  * Reader can have a transformer, ReaderT, which can be used to compose other monads with the Reader (not covered here)
